# SFMLStereo
  
Simple stereo sound class for SFML, to use mostly for Spatialization.  
It misses some functions available in the regular sf::Sound class but it's in an usable state right now.  
The right and left channels share some parameters (volume, pitch, etc...) but they can be moved independently.
